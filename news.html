          <h2>Back workouts | The best back exercises for building muscle and strength</h2>
          <p>The back is one of the largest sections of muscle and bone in the human body. Because of its size, the back
            is more prone to injury and damage than other areas, which makes strengthening the muscles in the area
            vital.

          <p>Do you shy away from the gym for fear of damaging your joints? You needn’t be worried. Exercise can in fact
            help to protect your joints, as well as relieve pain. “I don’t do that exercise because it’s bad for your
            joints.” Sound familiar? It’s a common reason people avoid exercises like running, weight training or some
